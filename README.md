Intuitively Controlled Robotic Arm 

This is a project completed by Jason Tan, Thomas Markes, and Stefan Wojciechowski in March 2012. With any luck the vhdl source code will be posted soon. The paper is the main reference to the work conducted and problems overcome during the duration of the ~month long project. 

The result was a reasonably accurate, realtime humanoid robotic arm controlled via a crappy SD camera, a xilinx spartan-3 FPGA, some posterboard and a handful of cheapservos from taiwan. If there was ever a hack, this was it. 

videos of our prototype are available upon request.

cheers!
